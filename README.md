# The World's Easiest Game

## About
A spinoff of The World's Hardest Game built as a C program for the Gameboy Advanced Emulator. The game was built as part of the CS 2110 course at Georgia Tech.

## Controls
The gameplay is similar to The World's Hardest Game where you avoid blue enemies and aim to get to the other light green area. You must collect all coins in the game before going to the goal. The up, down, left, and right arrows let you control the red square. Backspace is the select button and enter is the start button.

## Gameplay
